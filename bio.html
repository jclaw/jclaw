                My name is Jackson Clawson, and I am a sophomore at Tufts University currently pursuing a double major in Human Factors Engineering and Computer Science. The Human Factors Engineering program at Tufts incorporates ergonomics, product design, interaction design, and psychology into one interdisciplinary major.

I have had substantial design experience at work, in classes, and on my own. I interned last summer at <a href="versal.com">Versal</a>, a San Francisco internet startup, and did graphic/UI/UX design work for them. Iâ€™ve taken design classes at Tufts and outside of school to develop formal ways of analyzing design and strengthen my graphic communication skills. On my own, I have designed logos and done branding/marketing work for myself, for friends and family, and for bands that I am in. See more on my website.

I am currently taking a Computer Interface Design class at Tufts, and I have never been more engaged in the material of a class before. We will have six projects for which we will design interfaces for various devices, ranging from mobile and desktop web designs to a car digital interface to the screen for a mobile brownie maker. Projects from this class are featured on my <a href="jacksonclawson.com">website</a>.
